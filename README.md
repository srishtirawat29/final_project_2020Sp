# final_project
After reading several news pieces on the possible affect of temperature on the spread of Corona Virus, we decided to take it up as a projet and explore the correlation between temperature and covid-18 both through the United States and the World.
While exploring our data, we also designed another hypithesis which relates the population os the area to the number of cases it may have. We studied this for the states here in America.

Hypothesis 1: Warmer States within the US have lesser cases of COVID-19.
Hyposthesis 2: States with lower population will have lesser number of cases. 
Hypothesis 3: Warmer countries have lesser number of COVID-19 cases.

## Design Philosophy and Assumptions - <br/>
-The idea was to bust myths and find for ourseleves if there was any correlation between temperature and the COVID-19 cases.
-The data for the 3rd case has been taken from Jan 1,2020 till May 05,2020.
-We picked the countries for the 3rd Hypothesis and categorized them into hot and cold based on the fact that countries in the northern hemisphere experience winter during the time period we have considered and countries in the southern hemisphere have summers during the same time.
